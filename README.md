# Neon-Party

###### **Warning: Neon Party may cause epileptic seizure for those who are easily disturbed by flashing lights.**

Neon Party is a acid rave JS script I made to have a rave party in my dorm room at collage with all my class mates.
By running this script at full screen on all 3 computer monitors and on my 47' TV it created a hell of a rave party.
With 20 drunk people stuffed into my dorm and these crazy aids flashing lights I made sure non of them left without having an epileptic seizure. Use this at own risk.

1. Downlaod this the src code and run the index.html file in any modern browser or click this link here: [NEON PARTY](https://cdn.rawgit.com/EwyBoy/Neon-Party/5b3e6e8d/index.html)
