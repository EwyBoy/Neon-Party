# Neon-Party

###### **Warning: Neon Party may cause epileptic seizure for those who are easily disturbed by flashing lights.**

Neon Party is a acid rave JS script I made to have a rave party in my dorm room at collage with all my class mates.
By running this script at full screen on all 3 computer monitors and on my 47' TV it created a hell of a rave party.
With 20 drunk people stuffed into my dorm and these crazy aids flashing lights I made sure non of them left without having an epileptic seizure. Use this at own risk.
